          <Typography paragraph>
            Do not discriminate against anyone in the community! Difference of
            opinion is expected, but that does not give you permission to
            attack, degrade, insult, or otherwise belittle anyone. Harassment,
            gaslighting or abuse of any member is a serious offense that can
            lead to permanently being ejected from the community.

            To keep Daddy‚Äôs Dollhouse an inclusive space, we must be mindful of

            kink!

            with their conduct. Stewing in hate, fear or anger doesn't solve

            as to why. Just because another user may be OK with this sort of
            engagement doesn‚Äôt mean this specific user is. If you‚Äôre unsure of
            your boundaries with said user, ask for clarification. This user
            does not need to hear your reasoning for your actions. Please just
            be respectful and do not do that to them again.
